# Election-Analysis

## Project Overview

A Colorado Board of Elections employee, Tom, asked me to use Python to iterate over a CSV file containing election results for a recent U.S. Congressional precinct in Colorado and report on the following:

- The total number of votes cast
- The total number of votes for each candidate
- The percentage of votes for each candidate
- The winner of the election based on popular vote

The goal of this project is to audit the results and certify the winner of the election.
